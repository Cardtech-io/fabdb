WTR,0,Heart of Fyendal,F,"**Legendary** *(You may only have 1 Heart of Fyendal in your deck.)*

When you pitch Heart of Fyendal, if you have less [life] than your opponent, gain 1[life].","Deep within the wilderness, a tree falls, succumbing to the passage of time. As the wood rots, its essence flows into the earth, fuelling the new life which blossoms amongst the moss and stone. The ruler of the jungle deep, a predator without equal, is lost in slumber… yet its heart still beats, somewhere amongst the undergrowth, echoing the endless cycle of life and death.","The Heart of Fyendal was the first fabled card for Flesh & Blood. Additionally, it was a wonderful surprise to the community, as [Legend Story Studios](https://legendstory.com) never mentioned that such a card existed in the lead up to its release. As a result, the first player to find the Heart was confused by what they had found, as were we all.","generic,resource,gem",,,3,,,
