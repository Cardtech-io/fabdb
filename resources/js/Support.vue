            <p class="my-4">To support fabdb.net, go to our
                <a href="https://www.patreon.com/fabdb" target="_blank" class="text-orange-700 hover:text-gray-300">patreon
                    page</a> and sign up there or donate via our
                <a href="https://www.paypal.me/kirkbushell" class="text-orange-700 hover:text-gray-300">paypal page</a> :)</p>

            <p class="my-4">Currently, fabdb is a work of love, a contribution to the broader community to help everyone in
                researching cards, as well as managing their collections and decks. It is a completely free service, but
                that doesn't mean it's free to me - time spent, hosting, design, expanding the service, all costs money.</p>

            <p class="my-4">For the price of a coffee every month, you can help me in building what I hope to be the
                ultimate resource and suite of tools for my fellow fleshy, bloody TCG players! Or, you can donate with a
                one-off payment via paypal. Or, if neither of these options appeal to you, that's absolutely fine - just
                spreading the word and telling other players about this website, is super helpful!</p>

            <p class="my-4">All money raised as part of this endeavour will go directly into the project, by helping to cover the
                various costs, and then expanding it further. I badly want this game to be "the new classic" that Legend
                Story has designed it to be! </p>

            <p class="my-4">Together, we can get it there! :)</p>
