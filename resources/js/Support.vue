            <p>
                You can't have a great TCG without great stores. FaB DB aims to support stores by providing
                opportunities for stores to showcase their wares. Our immediate offering is syncing your single
                card listings with our card database, showcasing your store's products right here on FaB DB. In future,
                advertising and other opportunities will also be available.

            <p class="my-4">To support fabdb.net, go to our
                <a href="https://www.patreon.com/fabdb" target="_blank" class="link">patreon
                    page</a> and sign up there or donate via our
                <a href="https://www.paypal.me/kirkbushell" class="link">paypal page</a> :)</p>

            <p class="my-4">FaB DB is a work of love, a contribution to the broader community to help everyone in
                researching cards, as well as managing their collections and decks. It is a completely free service, but
                that doesn't mean it's free to us - time spent, hosting, design, expanding the service, all costs money.</p>

            <p class="my-4">For the price of a coffee every month, you can help in building what we hope to be the
                ultimate resource and suite of tools for our fellow fleshy, bloody, TCG players!</p>

            <p class="my-4">All money raised as part of this endeavour will go directly into the project, by helping to cover the
                various costs, and then expanding it further. I badly want this game to be "the new classic" that Legend
                Story has designed it to be! </p>

            <p class="my-4">Together, we can get it there! :)</p>
